# Capstone

## Outline

#### The aim of this project is to create a 2D platform side scrolling arcade style game. Some of the objectives are to integrate a current generation console controller to play the game, to create an entertaining game and to complete the project within projected deadlines

## Management strategy

#### For the purpose of this project we will be using SCRUM as our project management framework. SCRUM approaches project management by prioritizing the work that matters most and breaking it down to manageable criteria and tasks. SCRUM is mainly managed by sprints. These are time boxed iterations that can be 1-4 weeks but are generally 2 weeks. SCRUM as includes a product backlog, sprint backlog and burn down charts. The product backlog is a list of the functionality that needs to be added to the project and is prioritized by the project owner so the most valuable features are completed first. The sprint backlog is a prioritized list of tasks to complete during a sprint. A burn down chart shows the amount of work to be complete in a sprint and is a good way of telling is a sprint is on target.
